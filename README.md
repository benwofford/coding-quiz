## Build Status ##

This project is currently incomplete as of time of submission but I intend to fix the necessary issues like getting the high score leaderboard to show up.
## Screenshots ##

Here is where the game ends. I've struggled with getting the proper script to run the end of the game and bring up the high scores.

## Features ##

This features some questions and answers and it will tell you if you are right or wrong and keep score.

## Code Example ##

I'm struggling in particular getting my Javascript to populate the HTML elements of "section 3" & "section 4", you'll see my failed attempts commented out at line 123;

/* if (quiz[questionCount.length] > 5) {
  stop.timeleft;
  showSection3();
  showSection4();
} */
